I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

*Lab 2, Part 1

    I enjoyed working on this lab because it was a very fun way to create a story based on the user's input. In this lab, we provided prompts for users to respond to. The response would fill gaps in the statement made, like mad libs. Through this project I learned how to declare and initialize string variables. This lab also taught me how to make the output look clean  and user friendly.

*Lab 11, Part 2

    I enjoyed working on this lab because of the creative guessing game implemented into it. When it was done, it was so interesting to see it all come together. I also enjoy games so it was cool to create one. Through this project, I was able to broaden my knowledge and understanding of random number generation and constructors to initialize variables. 

*Lab 10, Part 1

    I enjoyed working on this lab because it was very exciting to figure out how to loop the data and get out exactly what I needed. Through this lab I learned how to use nested vector data structures. I also got a lot of practice with loops that have specific limitations and requirements. I learned more about how to convert strings to integers using std::stoi.
